Here at OpenSensors we are committed to making it as easy as possible
to get started with your IOT projects. You can now have the ability to
post messages through OpenSensors using HTTP-POST as well as MQTT. 

To post a message to a topic simply use this URL:
https://opensensors.io/topics/TopicID and adding the client-id and
password of your device as well as your username in the header

An example command using Curl is: 

    curl -X POST -H 'client-id: XX' -H 'password: XXXXXXX' -H 'username: yods' https:opensensors.io/topics/users/yods/foo -d '{"value": 1}'

Next up is support for another great IOT protocol, CoAP!! My policy is
that we will support any open standard and protocol so if there is a
particular protocol you love feel free to send us an [email](hello@opensensors.io).
